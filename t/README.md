# test suite

This test suite is based on [sharness](http://mlafeldt.github.io/sharness/)

## install

It is installed (from toplevel dir) with:

    git subtree add --squash --prefix t/sharness https://github.com/mlafeldt/sharness master

and update from time to time with:

    git subtree pull --squah --prefix t/sharness master

Read http://blogs.atlassian.com/2013/05/alternatives-to-git-submodule-git-subtree/ for more info on git subtree, you can define a remote to simplify commands or contribute sharness from your fork

## automation

Although every test is executable by itselft an only depends on sharness, that's not operative. this test suite relays on [prove](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Harness/bin/prove) and ancient and good-know [make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to complete the test suite. Launch it with 

    make 

or

    make DEFAULT_TEST_TARGET=prove
